	<h3>RESTful API and Django Framework</h3>
	<p>Django Framework is a free, scalable and modular framework using by more and more developers and also getting more popular among a big range of web frameworks nowadays. Our group started our first task by using it and its RESTful API framework trying to deliver a API that contain and serve information for Botanic Garden visitors with the intent of using Botanic Garden Path Mapper Android Application.</p>
	<p>Get Familiar with RESTful API by starting with .Net API library<br />
	<br />
	Our project group firstly using .Net library to grasp RESTful API in a easier way by building up a C# application to grab user input from its provided search box, when user click search button it will send user’s query parameter within a URL(http request) to Digital NZ’s API, and then getting response back with some raw JSON data for parsing straight after it, end up with showing a human readable data in the search feedback form.

	It was a bit tricky to filter out which one to use in .Net libraries since there were a large amount of them available for doing this same action. And unfortunately I was mistakenly choosing a wrong one called ‘ASP.Net Web API 1.0’, which was too complex for me to get through all its provided class, so quite stumbled me along the way to send a proper http request at very beginning, then I tried to ask help from one of my group member Andrew and he helped me with finding a real understandable http class from the library called ‘HttpWebRequest’ that basically wrap up everything useful to properly send a http request to Digital NZ API. 

	Additionally, peer programming was also played a important role through this part of task when we tried to set up dynamic Image in one column of a grid view within C#Application. Me, Andrew, and Matt were able to save big amount of time than work separately on each of our own by just following the step provided by MSDN documentation to build up a data GridView together and customised one column to show Bitmap image rather than normal text.

	By those practices that played around with RESTful API in .NET, it gave me more general ideas on what is it. To my understanding, it could basically described as a URL that is able to located the query resource, and use http verb(GET, POST, DELETE, DETC) to describe this upcoming process, so with all these which made me feeling more confidence working with actual Django RESTful API framework in the next.</ br>
