	<p>RESTful API and Django Framework<br />
	<br />
	Django Framework is a free, scalable and modular framework using by more and more developers and also getting more popular among a big range of web frameworks nowadays. Our group started our first task by using it and its RESTful API framework trying to deliver a API that contain and serve information for Botanic Garden visitors with the intent of using Botanic Garden Path Mapper Android Application.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Get Familiar with RESTful API by starting with .Net API library</h3>
	<p>Our project group firstly using .Net library to grasp RESTful API in a easier way by building up a C# application to grab user input from its provided search box, when user click search button it will send user’s query parameter within a URL(http request) to Digital NZ’s API, and then getting response back with some raw JSON data for parsing straight after it, end up with showing a human readable data in the search feedback form.</p>

	<h3>Technical challenge 1: Chosen a right library</h3>
	<p>It was a bit tricky to filter out which one to use in .Net libraries since there were a large amount of them available for doing this same action. And unfortunately I was mistakenly choosing a wrong one called ‘ASP.Net Web API 1.0’, which was too complex for me to get through all its provided class, so quite stumbled me along the way to send a proper http request at very beginning, then I tried to ask help from one of my group member Andrew and he helped me with finding a real understandable http class from the library called ‘HttpWebRequest’ that basically wrap up everything useful to properly send a http request to Digital NZ API. </p>
