								Howdy! My name is Linru Li, or you can call me Victor! I came to New Zealand four years ago and studied the Bachelor of Information Technology at Otago Polytechnic as an international student. After three years studying, both my technical skills and my English skills have improved much more than I can ever imagine. Apart from studying here, I am also enjoying the lifestyle.  Making lots of local friends is one of the best things I have done during my time here. Experiencing different cultures gives us a new understanding, which is interesting for me. Spending time working with others in the Community Software group has given me more chances to improve myself from all aspects. It is a precious experience and the best time of my life. 							</p>
							<p>
								The more I learn about IT, the more interested in it I become. Not only is it booming in the 21st century but also its capability of accomplishing new and exciting things continues to grow. Three years of studying would not be the end of the learning process; on the contrary, it is just the beginning of my exploration into more exciting things in this industry. 							</p>
							<p>
								I am going to learn more about AI and machine learning as I believe it is a trend for the future. As computers develop faster and faster, one day we will see ever more fantastic applications coming out from it.
