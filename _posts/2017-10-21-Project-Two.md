<p>Just like what one of my group members said before: "Project group has been a ride of many ups and downs, stress, laughs, and feelings of accomplishment." Throughout this whole year studying in the Community Software group, I am not only learned a bunch of new skills that would become useful in my future career, but I also knew a lot of nice people and reaped lasting friendship. More importantly, I am now more confident and more prepared to get into the real working environment, to adapt, to adjust and anneal myself to new changes.</p>
