**Technical Proficiency**

1. What is the overall quality of my code like?

Being an Android front-end developer in this semester, I have acquired lots of knowledge of coding. Excepts wrote my code; I would also like to look others code and talk about it with them. Despite the absence of Object-Oriented Systems Design class, I still learned a lot from that habit. For example, one of my group members wrote an interface to query the information of plants, before I use this interface I went through his code and talked to him about something I confused. Since then I was more confident to use that, and I did some changes according to my needs.

I would say my quality of my code becomes better than in Project1. Data structures were concerned (Inheritance, Interface) and methods naming became more understandable. Instead of putting all code into one method, I rather made them be different methods for debugging purpose, and at the same time made the code a better modularity.



2. How well did I follow best practices in development?

Our group stick with Agile Software Development. We used team communication tools called slack frequently, and Trello board and whiteboard for project management. Each team member took turns at participating the role of scrum master. Additionally, we split tasks into each sprint so that we can achieve them in a short time, also made us easier to respond to client requirements rapidly during the development. Our group also agreed on several time points for the meetup. Monday 1 pm normally was the time for short sum up of what you have done since last week and what a new plan would be for this week. Wednesday 1 pm and Friday 12:30 pm would be the time to talk about what each one of us has been working on and what could be obstacles on your way through. Those practices highly aligned our team and hence improve the development.



3. How well did I use appropriate version control?

We launched a repository dedicated for PathMapper this semester. Any significant changes made by anyone would be accepted only by making a pull request from their own branch. I had my personal branch to work on and made clear comments everytime I pushed to the branch, so I think I followed this convention pretty well.



4. To what extent do I think I contributed an equal portion of the overall project?

A decent amount of them. I worked hard and did lots of research to get GPS working as more accurate as I can. A majority of the time I spent was to get different types of markers working properly in this App. We first had a decision to let collection markers pop up(using marker cluster lib from google) as device moving but end up with lousy accuracy, so we changed our direction to displaying all collections markers all at once. After tapping a specific collection marker, the screen would then shows all items from that collection. It was quite challenging to distinguish all those markers. I got around with it using tags which brought me more time to work on other parts of the App.



**Professional proficiency**

1. How often do I attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?

I attended every group scrum and meeting. It was crucial to be with others at that time as you would know what our group direction is going to be. Since those did not only make sure that everyone is right on the track but also was being helpful when someone or yourself which got stumbled on the way through.



2. How well did I communicate with others in your group or subgroup?

My communication skills improved a lot throughout this semester. Since English is my second language, I tried hard to talk to everyone not only for understanding what is going on in our group but also tried to speak out as much as I can in any occasions. On the slack channel, we also had our subgroup for some detailed discussion of the project, and I had positive responses to every problem we had talked about.  All my teammates were really helpful during the time, so I think I have communicated pretty well with them.

3. How well did I document your work throughout the project?

During the development, I did not think I documented my works enough. When halfway through the project, one of my teammates joint into our subgroup. The coming up problem is because we have not done enough inline commenting, so he was not able to totally understand the code at the first time. By the time we realized it and started to do more commenting as we go. Obviously, things would have been easier when all of us commented out our code as we go. Since then I realized how vital the commenting is. Therefore for I spend a decent amount of time trying to make our final documentation as much more understandable as I can even for a non-specialist.



4. How well did I respond to problems or changing requirements?

It is quite normal that client changes their ideas along the way. We had a few times about it as well. For example, viewing items in a collection seems hard to understand because of the multiple user interfaces in one screen. These changes requirements could be time-consuming. Fortunately, we had a good plan throughout the development, it won&#39;t affect us on the entire progress too much but still, aim at a striking product prototype with the client at the very beginning seems essential and vital.
