**Technical Proficiency**

**1. What is the overall quality of my code like?  4.5 out of 5**

Being an Android front-end developer this semester, I have acquired lots of knowledge of coding. Besides writing my own code; I would also like to look at others' code and talk about it with them. Even though I did not attend the Object-Oriented Systems Design class, I still learned a lot about it from others. For example, one of my group members wrote an interface to query the information of plants, before I used this interface I went through his code and talked to him about something that confused me. Since then I was more confident to use interfaces, and I did some changes in my code to accommodate what I had learned.
I would say the quality of my code became better since Project1. Data structures were involved in my code (Inheritance, Interface) and method naming became more understandable. Rather than putting all code into one method, I extracted different methods and at the same time gave the code more modularity.



**2. How well did I follow best practices in development?  5 out of 5**

Our group had an Agile Software Development structure. We used team communication tools like Slack frequently, and Trello board and whiteboard for project management. Each team member took turns at participating as the role of scrum master. Additionally, we split tasks into each sprint so that we can achieve them in a short time, which also made it easier to respond to client requirements rapidly during the development. Our group also agreed on several time points for the meetup. Monday 1 pm normally was the time for a short sum up of what each of us had done since last week and what the new plan would be for this week. Wednesday 1 pm and Friday 12:30 pm would be the time to talk about what each of us has been working on and what obstacles might be in your way. Those practices helped aligned our team and hence improved the development.



**3. How well did I use appropriate version control?  5 out of 5**

We launched a repository dedicated for PathMapper this semester. Any significant changes made by anyone would be accepted only by making a pull request from their own branch. I had my personal branch to work on and made clear messages everytime I pushed to the branch, so I think I followed this convention pretty well.


**4. To what extent do I think I contributed an equal portion of the overall project?  5 out of 5**

I contributed a decent amount towards the overall project. I worked hard and did lots of research to get GPS working as accurately as possible. A majority of the time I spent was to get different types of markers working properly in this App. We first made a decision to let collection markers pop up(using marker cluster library from google) as devices moving, but because of this the positioning had lousy accuracy, so we changed our development direction to displaying all collections markers all at once. After tapping a specific collection marker, the screen would show all items from that collection. It was quite challenging to distinguish all those markers in the code. I got around it by simply using tags which bought me more time to work on other parts of the App.



**Professional proficiency**

**1. How often do I attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?  5 out of 5**

I attended every group scrum and meeting. It was crucial to be with others at that time as you would know what our group direction is going to be. If someone was having difficulty with their task, the others would help you find a solution and get you back on track.



**2. How well did I communicate with others in your group or subgroup?  5 out of 5**

My communication skills improved a lot throughout this semester.  Since English is my second language, I tried hard to talk to everyone not only for understanding what is going on in our group but also to speak out as much as I can on any occasion. On the slack channel, we also had our subgroup for the detailed discussion of the project, and I had positive responses to every problem we talked about.  All my teammates were really helpful so I think I have communicated pretty well with them.

**3. How well did I document your work throughout the project?  4.5 out of 5**

During the development, I did not think I documented my work enough. When halfway through the project, one of my teammates joint our subgroup. There was a problem: we had not done enough inline commenting so he was not able to totally understand the code at the time. When we realized this, we started to do more commenting from that point onwards. Obviously, things would have been easier if all of us commented our code from the very beginning.
Since then I realized how vital the commenting is. Therefore I spend a decent amount of time trying to make our final documentation as much more understandable and comprehensive as I can even for a non-specialist.




**4. How well did I respond to problems or changing requirements?  5 out of 5**

It is quite normal that clients change their ideas along the way. This happened to us a few times as well. For example, viewing items in a collection seems hard to understand because of the multiple user interfaces on one screen. These change requirements could be time-consuming. Fortunately, we had a good plan throughout the development, it would not affect our entire progress too much. Creating a striking product prototype for the client at the very beginning was essential to us.
